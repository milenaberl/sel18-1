            through any number of public key based protocols such as IPSec, PGP, S/MIME, or SSL. However, how do they know each other's public keys? The goal of a
            public key infrastructure (PKI) is to enable secure, convenient, and efficient discovery of public keys. It should be applicable within as well as
            between organizations, and scalable to support the Internet. There are various types of PKI that are widely deployed or have been proposed. They
            differ in the configuration information required, trust rules, and flexibility. There are standards such as X.509 and PKIX, but these are
            sufficiently flexible so that almost any model of PKI can be supported. We describe several types of PKI and discuss the advantages and
            disadvantages of each. We argue against several popular and widely deployed models as being insecure, unscalable, or overly inconvenient. We also
            recommend a particular model.},

Abstract = {Companies and organizations employ PKI technology to secure the communication in their intranets and over the internet. The services of authentication, non-repudiation, confidentiality and the transport of authorization information are often supported by X.509 certificates. The synchronization of the certificates' life-cycle with the management of the PKI users is a common problem. We propose a mechanism to achieve this synchronization based on directory services. This enables to transparently update the information provided by the PKI and offers a high potential for automation. The mechanism spares personnel and is less error-prone, since it relies on processes and data that are already established. It reduces the costs to bootstrap and operate the infrastructure. We show a case study on the proposed mechanism that was conducted at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany in order to supply 20 000 students with certificates and keys.

Abstract = {The article presents information on digital certificates. A public-key certificate is a data structure used to securely bind a public key to attributes. A standard for identification certificates is contained within the international standards for directories. An X.509 certificate binds a public key to a directory name and identifies the entity who vouches for the binding. The whole data structure is digitally signed in approximately the same fashion as an privacy enhanced mail is signed. The certificate is validated by verifying the signature applied by the issuer of the certificate. This use of certificate transforms the problem of acquiring the public key associated with a user into one of acquiring the public key of the issuer of the user's certificate. A certificate, like a credit card, does not remain valid forever. It naturally expires when the validity interval passes, or it may be revoked by the issuer if the binding between the subject and the subject public key is no longer},

Abstract = {Public key cryptography can uniquely enable trust within distributed settings. Employing it usually requires deploying a set of tools and services collectively known as a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). PKIs have become a central asset for many organizations, due to distributed IT and users. Even though the usage of PKIs in closed and controlled environments is quite common, interoperability and usability problems arise when shifting to a broader, open environment. To make an effective trust judgment about a public key certificate, a PKI user needs more than just knowledge of that certificate: she also needs to be able to locate critical parameters such as the certificate repositories and certificate validation servers relevant to that certificate – and all the others the trust path she builds for it. Surprisingly, locating these resources and services remains a largely unsolved problem in real-world X.509 PKI deployment. This issue impacts especially on the usability of this technol},

Abstract = {Public Key Infrastructures have not reached the widespread diffusion expected of them, although they are well understood from a security point of view, because, like many say, the killer application has not been found yet. The lack of a clear understanding of the performance of these systems also contributes significantly to their limited diffusion. Studies have appeared of specific aspects of the operations of PKIs, but no complete studies of the overall system are known.In this paper we present an evaluation study of X.509-compliant Public Key Infrastructures using queuing network models. We focus our analysis on the performance of the subsystem in charge of generating and managing digital certificates, under a variety of load conditions, both in terms of the type of requests and their number. We also investigate the impact on the performance of the system of some implementation choices such as revocation mechanisms and auditing activities. The main result of our analysis is that th},

Abstract = {Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based Web services are subject to the same attacks that exploit XML. The popular Web Services Security 1.0 (WSS) standard addresses authentication and authorization, but not Structured Query Language Injection and other attacks. The three basic threats to Web services and XML are conventional identity-based attacks, malicious content attacks and operational attacks. WSS defines two profiles that address authentication and authorization: the UsernameToken Profile and X.509 Certificate Profile. Each provides the same information: an identity that is verifiable by an edge security device or by the application. Limiting access to corporate Web services is the first step in implementing a strong security policy. The second step is understanding the potential vulnerabilities in XML communication so users can protect their Web services environment from them.

Abstract = {Abstract: Since the turn of the millenium, working groups of the W3C have been concentrating on the development of XML-based security standards, which are paraphrased as XML security. XML security consists of three recommendations: XML (digital) signature, XML encryption and XML key management specification (XKMS), all of them published by the W3C. By means of a review of the available literature the authors draw several conclusions about the status quo of XML security. Furthermore, the current state and focuses of research as well as the existing challenges are derived. Trends to different application areas – e.g. use of XML security for mobile computing – are also outlined. Based on this information the analyzed results are discussed and a future outlook is predicted. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]},
